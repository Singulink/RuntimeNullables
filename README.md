# Runtime Nullables

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Singulink/RuntimeNullables](https://badges.gitter.im/Singulink/RuntimeNullables.svg)](https://gitter.im/Singulink/RuntimeNullables?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This package automatically adds null checks to method/property entry and exit points based on the standard C# 8+ Nullable Reference Type (NRT) annotations and attributes. It is capable of checking input parameters as well as outputs (i.e. return values and `out`/`ref` parameters) and supports comprehensive checks on the full range of special method types including `async Task<T>` methods, `Task<T>` methods that synchronously return completed tasks (i.e. using `Task.FromResult<T>`), `IEnumerable<T>` iterators as well as `async IAsyncEnumerable<T>` iterators. Custom throw helpers can be defined to fully customize the exceptions thrown to your liking.

## Installation

The package is available on NuGet - simply install the `RuntimeNullables.Fody` package into your project and you are good to go - null checks will be automatically injected when your project builds! It is also a good idea to add the latest `Fody` package directly to your project to ensure you are using an up-to-date version to avoid issues.

## Runtime Nullables v.s. NullGuard.Fody

I was the primary contributor to add NRT support to NullGuard but I wanted something simpler and more streamlined specifically designed for use with NRTs. Unfortunately, NullGuard has a lot of "legacy" functionality in it which makes expanding features and optimizing behavior for NRTs very difficult and I found the attribute model to be overly complex. This weaver was written from the ground up with only NRTs in mind. Some notable improvements in Runtime Nullables include:

- Does not force `.initlocals` on methods (better performance, especially with `stackalloc`).
- More efficient weaving algorithm for faster build times.
- Supports checking `ValueTask<T>` results, synchronously returned complete `Task<T>` results, and `IEnumerable<T>`/`IAsyncEnumerable<T>` iterator values.
- Uses throw helpers instead of throwing directly (better performance / smaller IL code) and lets you define your own custom throw helpers.
- Much simpler attribute model that uses a single `[NullChecks(bool)]` attribute to control null check injection.
- Designed specifically for NRTs so it is much easier to add advanced functionality such as full validation of conditional attributes like `[MaybeNullWhen]` (coming soon).
- Outputs warnings for conflicting annotations that cause null checks to be skipped, i.e. if `[AllowNull, DisallowNull]` is applied to a parameter.
- Uses `NullReferenceException` instead of `InvalidOperationException` when an output check fails since the latter is often used and caught in normal circumstances and thus problems might not be caught in unit tests or code.
- Numerous bug fixes and reliability improvements.

## Configuration

By default, null checks are added based on the build configuration as follows:
- `Release`: input parameter values on publicly exposed methods/properties only
- `Debug`: input and output (`ref`/`out`) parameter values and return values on all methods/properties

The behavior can be configured in one of two ways: inside your `.csproj` file or using a `FodyWeavers.xml` configuration file in the root of your project. There are two configuration settings:

- `CheckOutputs`: If set to `true` then outputs (i.e. return values, ref/out parameters) will be null checked, otherwise these checks are omitted.
- `CheckNonPublic`: If set to `true` then all methods/properties are checked, otherwise only those that are potentially publicly exposed are checked.

If configuring via the `.csproj` file then you have to add a `<WeaverConfiguration>` property like so:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
    <WeaverConfiguration>
      <Weavers>
        <RuntimeNullables CheckNonPublic="true" CheckOutputs="true" />
      </Weavers>
    </WeaverConfiguration>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

If you would like to configure settings with a `FodyWeavers.xml` file in the project then simply build the project after adding the `RuntimeNullables.Fody` package and it will automatically generate an xml configuration file for you which you can then edit. Alternatively, you can add the file manually with the following contents:

```xml
<Weavers xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="FodyWeavers.xsd">
  <RuntimeNullables CheckNonPublic="true" CheckOutputs="true" />
</Weavers>
```

If you omit the `CheckNonPublic` or `CheckOutputs` setting then it will fallback to the default behavior based on the build configuration as explained above.

## Fine Tuning Behavior

Injection of null checks can be fine tuned in your code using the `[RuntimeNullables.NullChecks(bool)]` attribute which can be applied at the assembly, class, method/property or return value level. For example, if you apply `[NullChecks(false)]` to a class it will disable null checks on every member in that class unless it has `[NullChecks(true)]` applied to it. It is important to note that if the `CheckOutputs` or `CheckNonPublic` setting is `false` then that will override any `[NullChecks(true)]` attribute applied to an output or non-public member. In other words, if the setting is set to `false` then those particular checks are never emitted, regardless of the presence of a `[NullChecks(true)]` attribute.

Additionally, custom throw helpers can be defined to customize the exceptions that are thrown. In order to do that, you simply add an internal `ThrowHelpers` class into your project in the `RuntimeNullables` namespace and match the signature of the throw helper you want to override and it will be used instead of the defaults. The default throw helpers are as follows:

```c#
namespace RuntimeNullables
{
	internal static class ThrowHelpers
	{
		internal static void ThrowArgumentNull(string paramName)
		{
			throw new ArgumentNullException(paramName);
		}

		internal static void ThrowOutputNull(string message)
		{
			throw new NullReferenceException(message);
		}

		internal static Exception GetAsyncResultNullException(string message)
		{
			return new NullReferenceException(message);
		}
	}
}
```

If an output check or async result check fails then `message` parameter contains a message specifying exactly what caused the check to fail, i.e. "Enumerator result nullability contract was broken."

## Examples

```C#
using RuntimeNullables;

// Return value is not null checked since it is nullable,
// but method throws NullArgumentException if messageService is null
public string? GetMessage(MessageService messageService);

// The 'value' parameter is null checked on method entry as well as when the method exits since it is a ref
public void UpdateMessage(ref string value);

// Now the 'value' parameter is only null checked on method entry due to the [MaybeNull] annotation
public void UpdateMessage([MaybeNull] ref string value);

// Each item returned by the enumeration is null checked
public IEnumerable<string> GetMessages()
{
    string nullValue = null;
    yield return "some value";
    yield return "some other value";
    yield return nullValue; // NullReferenceException is thrown
}

public Task<T> GetValueAsync<T>()
{
    return Task.FromResult<T>(default); // NullReferenceException if T is a reference type
}

[return: NullChecks(false)]
public Task<T> GetValueAsync<T>()
{
    return Task.FromResult<T>(default); // This is okay now since return value null checks are disabled
}

// Result of the task is null checked
public async Task<string> GetMessageAsync()
{
    return await MessageService.GetMessageAsync();
}

// All results are null checked
public async IAsyncEnumerable<string> GetValuesAsync()
{
    await Task.Delay(100);
    yield return "Some value";
    await Task.Delay(100);
    yield return null; // NullReferenceException is thrown
}
```
